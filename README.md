Virtual Keyboard README

Overview

The Virtual Keyboard is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library. This application provides a virtual keyboard for users to input text and perform basic mathematical operations without relying on the physical keyboard. It is designed primarily for use in environments where security is a concern, such as preventing keyloggers from capturing sensitive information.

Features

Virtual Keyboard: A user-friendly layout of buttons representing keys, including letters, numbers, and basic operators.

Dynamic Input: Users can input text and perform calculations directly within the application interface.

Basic Functions:

Clear: Clear the entire input.

Backspace: Remove the last character from the input.

Delete: Clear the full input.

Quit: Close the application.

Evaluate Expression: Compute basic mathematical expressions, returning results directly in the input field.

Requirements

To run this application, you need to have:

Python 3.x installed on your machine

Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions)

Installation

Clone the repository (if applicable):

 
git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:
 
cd <project-directory>

Run the application: Make sure you have Python installed and run the following command:

 
python virtual_keyboard.py

Usage Instructions

Launch the application.

Use the virtual buttons to input letters, numbers, and mathematical operators.

To evaluate a mathematical expression, input the expression using the buttons and press the = button.

To clear the input field, press the Clear button.

Use the Backspace button to remove the last character or the Delete button to clear the entire input.

Press the Quit button to close the application.

Security Note

This virtual keyboard is intended as a tool to enhance security by preventing keyloggers from capturing keystrokes typed via a physical keyboard. However, while it can reduce risk, it is recommended always to use additional security measures such as antivirus software and keeping your system updated.

Future Enhancements

Support for more complex mathematical operations.

Customizable keyboard layout (e.g., different languages).

Additional security features, such as a password manager or one-time password generator.
